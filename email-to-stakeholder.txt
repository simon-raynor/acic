Hi Fred,

I tried to get in touch but I guess your phone died. I got your message
about the Advanced Compoter Intelligenced Colors work and have tried my
best to satisfy the requirements.

Points one through three should be working well, I didn't have time to
set up full testing but I haven't been able to break it yet. I
did have a somewhat philosophical moment when contemplating how to notify
the user that update logic has been suspended without running any update
logic. As a compromise I've added a message which will show if the screen
is too small on load.

To answer your question in point 4, Flux isn't expensive. It's an approach
to writing React apps (the thing the ACIC is built with), and while not
familiar with it myself I've tried to incorporate its principles to the
best of my ability. Hopefully I can get some feedback from the maintenance
team regarding how they want to move forwards with this (they've been
impossible to get in touch with too).

Point 5 is a tricky one, I think it refers to the river Reuss which "separates"
the Swiss city of Lucerne. I'm not certain though, are your dev team into
riddles by any chance? Regardless you can assure them that all efforts have
been made to make this project as easy for them to build upon, and to
follow modern standards with regards to code structure and maintainability.

You can see the app running at http://localhost:3000, let me know when you get
this message and we can work out how to proceed.

Kind Regards,

Simon
